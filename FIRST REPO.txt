Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

=> HTTP

HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol & it is used in client-server communication. By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & 
the server sends the response to the user. 

=> HTTP 1.1

* Developed by Timothy Berners-Lee in 1989 as a communication standard for the World Wide Web, 
HTTP is a top-level application protocol that exchanges information between a client computer and a local or remote web server. In this process,
a client sends a text-based request to a server by calling a method like GET or POST. In response, the server sends a resource like an HTML page back to the client.

* HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it In contrast.

* HTTP/1.1 which was created in 1997

* the uses works on the textual format.

* There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources.

* It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages

* It compresses data by itself.


=>HTTP 2

* Stream prioritization not only solves the possible issue of requests competing for the same resource, 
but also allows developers to customize the relative weight of requests to better optimize application performance. 
In this section, we will break down the process of this prioritization in order to provide better insight into how you can leverage this feature of HTTP/2.

* HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.

* HTTP/2 which was created in 2015

* It works on the binary protocol

* It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.

* It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 

* It uses HPACK for data compression.
